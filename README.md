# my workstation/server image

My own Linux "distro" based on universal blue's image template. 
Experimentation lab and testing ground based on Fedora Bootc.

## Installation

### Rebasing from Fedora Silverblue

Install Fedora Silverblue.
Once booted, run:

```
bootc switch ghcr.io/timn3/ws:latest
```

Then reboot.
